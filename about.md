The title of this site comes from a Kierkegaard quote:

>Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

I came out of college having double majored in physics and religion, but no real interest in pursuing either further. Furthermore, I had no real idea as to how to contribute meaningfully to the world, let alone what I really wanted to do with my life.

So, I decided to chase my childhood passions - music and video games - and ended up in a whirlwind of [part](http://www.cstarleague.com)-[time](http://www.cathedral.org) [jobs](http://geico.onog.gg) and [various](http://soundcloud.com/crescentia) [other](http://featheredmelody.bitbucket.org) [pet projects](http://houraiteahouse.net/) related to those interests. Along the way, I picked up some neat skills, met some amazing people, and eventually carved out a small but meaningful niche for myself. But...

In October 2015, I decided to take General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. It wasn't an easy decision, but having seen firsthand the disruptive, transformative power of technologies at work in the fields I'd enmeshed myself in, it made sense to me as the next step in the natural evolution of my ever-growing skillset. With a deeper appreciation for these tools, I now look forward to tackling bigger challenges, familiar and new.
